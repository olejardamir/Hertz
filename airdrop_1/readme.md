## Airdrop rules
1. Your twitter account must have a profile image and an activity for more than 2 weeks.

2. Your discord, instagram as well as a telegram account must have a profile image.

3. You must add Hertz properly to relevant social media, and send the ETH address as requested.

4. The "point" simply tells you how many tokens you will get. It is the minimum token number multiplied by points. For example, if minimum is 0.001 HZ and number of points for a task is 3, you will get 0.003 HZ tokens.

5. Please note, the price of 1 HZ token is currently about 1 HZ token (and slightly higher).

6. People who already added Hertz to Instagram can still participate.






## Where can I get more HZ tokens ?
Please go to a main webpage (https://gotohertz.com/index.html), click on DApps and select the Dapp from a popup window. Everything should be self-explanatory. The connection may be slow for some users, so please be patient for servers to give you the access to DApp deployed to Heroku.com servers. 

First, click on the "CLICK HERE TO ADD HERTZ TO METAMASK". Then, click on "GO TO HERTZ DAPP FOR TOKEN EXCHANGE".

You will need a browser wallet such as Metamask and some Ethereum on your account to purchase HZ. Please note, HZ token has no owner and everything is decentralized. You are the owner of your tokens! Furthermore, you can exchange them back to Ethereum any time, using the same DApp.
