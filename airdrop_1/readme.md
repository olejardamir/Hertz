## Where can I get more HZ tokens ?
Please go to a main webpage (https://gotohertz.com/index.html), click on DApps and select the Dapp from a popup window. Everything should be self-explanatory. You will need a browser wallet such as Metamask and some Ethereum on your account to purchase HZ. Please note, HZ token has no owner and everything is decentralized. You are the owner of your tokens! Furthermore, you can exchange them back to Ethereum any time.


## Airdrop rules
1. Your twitter account must have a profile image and an activity for more than 2 weeks.

2. Your discord, instagram as well as a telegram account must have a profile image.

3. You must add Hertz properly and send the ETH address as requested.

4. Point simply tells you how many tokens you will get. It is the minimum point number multiplied by points. For example, if minimum is 0.001 HZ and number of points for a task is 3, you will get 0.003 HZ tokens.

5. Please note, the price of 1 HZ token is currently about 1 HZ token (and slightly higher).


## How to apply
- Option 1: Twitter + Telegram (1 point). Add to Twitter, repost on Twitter and join the telegram group
