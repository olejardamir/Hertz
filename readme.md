# THIS WHITEPAPER IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION !

## Story behind, and a personal note ...
While coding a project which is supposed to allow people to mine BTC model without any hardware, thinking about what I am doing and why, I tried to come to a core explanation to all crypto-currencies and their market affairs. No matter how bad or good the project is, no matter what technology is applied, none of this matters as long as it can turn cents into dollars. It was a time to stop the coding and doing the complex things in vain, and simply follow the conclusion. What would happen if there were a stable-coin with a constantly increasing price ? If we can have stable-coins with a stable price relative to anything, then why not constantly increase that price ? what features must exist, and how would it work ? 

All of these questions had some solution, but it took a lot of thinking to come up with the best one.  As a great fan of a current fad called “deflationary coins”, I have noticed something awfully wrong with them... Although deflationary, their prices weren’t changing no matter how big or small the supply was. As a main developer of a project called ButtCoin (The Reaper, and Snayl), I have noticed one basic and simplest fact about people who are interested in the crypto-currencies... The truth is, majority of people simply want to make the money, and therefore good project is the one which helps them make the money. Furthermore, there is a very small amount of individuals who would contribute their hard efforts to any project, and for free. As a consequence, projects can gain the required publicity by depositing their investments, while at the end everyone ends-up losing to new technologies or the market manipulations.  It is just a matter of a time and a question of “when ?” the zero-sum (as in a game theory) kicks-in. Therefore, good projects are also the ones that simply prolong the inevitable destruction and a ruin (either financial or by the competing technologies). I have also seen great projects getting destroyed and burned to a ground with people losing their money in tears... 

For this reason, I have decided to make this a solo-project, unrelated to any past projects I was working on, and create a coin that will never have the falling prices. It is a coin where everyone can profit at any time... It is a project with a minimal loss of 2% and where the community can benefit from any behaviour associated with the market manipulations. Whales, bots, and other creatures will never go away, so it would be great if we could simply make them join us at one point where we can all benefit from one-another. I took an idea from deflationary coins to burn tokens at each transfer, but also to create a micro-exchange and a storage of Ethereum within a contract. The result was very simple while the implications are huge. Furthermore, I have realized that the code I have made can be used with any ERC20 token, and Tethter is the one on my list, which will be run in a parallel with Hertz. A generalized source-code with instructions will be made so that anyone can take it and generate their own token in order to deflate any other token they want. We can even deflate deflationary tokens, including the Hertz !  However, this is a topic beyond the scope of this white-paper.

## How does it work ?
The explanation is very simple. Imagine people putting money on one pile. Each time you want to take the money back, you have to leave 2% on the pile. Furthermore, each time you want to tell that someone else owns the money, you contribute 2% to a pile. The 2% that remain on a pile are shared with everyone since the Hertz token simply tells the proportion of a pile that you own rather than how much of money you own. Therefore, nobody can lose more than 2% of what they put on a pile, while everyone profits together. This is how we can have a deflationary stable-coin where nobody loses and where everyone gains at all time.


## About
- Pre-minted: 0
- Contract owner: nobody, meaning, nobody collects Ethereum.
- Decimals: 18. Since token price will always increase, zeros will become very important.
- Total Supply: 21000 tokens. Since we are using 18 decimals, 21000 tokens is enough to make traders put a token on exchanges due to a low supply, and sell it.
- Minting: when the current supply reaches 21000 we cannot mint more tokens. However, when tokens are burned by transferring or by exchanging back to Ethereum within a contract, the number becomes lower, and we can mint them again using the contract.
- Current Supply: The current supply shows the current amount of circulating tokens. The current supply is reduced by burning and increased by purchasing tokens from a contract.
- Trade fees: No fees for a token purchase, 2% for converting back to Ethereum. Initial idea was to have no fees at all, however, people could avoid burning Hertz by converting it to Ethereum. This is only a safety mechanism making sure that Hertz will be used as intended, at least once.
- Everyone profits when Ethereum is taken away from the contract.
- Everyone profits when token is transferred from one account to another.
- Starting price: 1 Ethereum = 1 Hertz. From that point, Hertz price is always increasing.
- Minimum purchase: 0.000000000000000001
- Maximum purchase: Total Supply minus Current Supply



## Performance and expectations
 
- Burning function has been commented-out because it can be used to abuse the contract. For example, if A and B invest, and then B decides to burn their tokens while A exchanges tokens back to Ethereum, we could have witnessed a possible money-laundering scheme. A 2% fee per transfer is good and slow enough to prevent this from happening. Furthermore, the burning would increase the prices in unpredictable manner, and it would lower the distribution of a token while implying a manipulation.

- Initial (TODO: update with the $$ number) has been deposited in order to lower the price increase rate. For example if person A places $0.1 and then burn 50%, they would have increased the price for anyone else to purchase a token. For this reason, the price-safety deposit has been made right after the token launch to prevent us from using too many zeros and too soon.

- It is not possible to miss-out on this token’s increasing price since the price is always increasing. Furthermore, since everyone profits together from the burning, there is no ponzi-scheme.

- In the beginning, the price will oscillate around token’s contract price. This is why the name Hertz was chosen. However, as the token becomes spread across the accounts, this will become more predictive.

- It is my highest hope that bots will work together with the human traders and holders, and that everyone will profit. This is simply because bots can profit from arbitrage between the contract’s price and the exchanges. When this happens, we will have a constant and a straight line of an increasing price. This way, we will all profit from the bots as the bots will profit from the token and exchanges.

- A new deflationary token will be created by someone else to deflate Hertz once we reach 21000 tokens as a current supply... or once we start using too many zeros; since the prices may become too high on exchanges. Furthermore the bots could take the arbitrage as an advantage earning more than others can earn if there is a large gap between the contract price and a market price. This deflationary token, however, is not going to be made by Hertz, while the general source-code will be available for anyone to make it.
