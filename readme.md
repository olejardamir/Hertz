# THIS WHITEPAPER IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION !

## Story behind ...
While coding a project which is supposed to allow people to mine BTC-like model without any hardware, thinking about what I am doing and why, I tried to come to a core explanation to all crypto-currencies and their market affairs. No matter how bad or good the project is, no matter what the technology is behind the coin, none of this matters as long as it can turn cents into dollars. It was a time to stop the coding and doing the complex things in vain, and simply follow the conclusion. What would happen if there were a stable-coin with the constantly increasing price ? If we can have stable-coins with a stable price relative to anything, then why not constantly increase that price ? what features must exist, how would it work at all ? 

All of these questions had some solution, but it took a lot of thinking to come up with the best one.  As a great fan of the current fad called “deflationary coins”, I have noticed something awfully wrong with all of them... Although deflationary, their prices weren’t changing no matter how big or small the supply was. As a main developer of a project called ButtCoin, which was done for fun and learning, there was one basic and the simplest fact about people who are interested in crypto-currencies... The truth is, majority of people are broke and want to make money out of nothing. Furthermore, there is a very small amount of individuals who would contribute anything to any project. As a consequence, the projects can gain the publicity, while at the end everyone ends-up losing.  It is just a matter of a time and a question of “when ?” the zero-sum game will kick-in. Therefore, good projects are the ones that simply prolong the inevitable destruction and a ruin. I have seen great projects getting destroyed and burned to a ground with people losing their money in tears... I have decided to make this a solo-project and create a coin that will never have falling prices, where everyone can profit at any time... I took an idea from deflationary coins to burn tokens at each transfer but also to create a micro-exchange and a storage of Ethereum within a contract. The result was very simple while the implications are huge. Furthermore, I have realized that the code I have made can be used with any ERC20 token, and Tethter is one on my list. A generalized source-code will be made so that anyone can take it and generate their own token in order to deflate any other token they want. We can even deflate deflationary tokens, including the Hertz !  This simply means that we can have an universal deflationary ERC20 token, for all tokens, which could be a matter of just one map initiated in a code. So instead of focusing on Tether, Hertz could be completed with another token that deflates all ERC20 tokens...

## About
- Pre-minted: 0
- Contract owner: nobody, meaning, nobody collects Ethereum.
- Decimals: 18. Since token price will always increase, zeros will become very important.
- Total Supply: 21000 tokens. Since we are using 18 decimals, 21000 tokens is enough to make traders put a token on exchanges due to a low supply, and sell it.
- Minting: when the current supply reaches 21000 we cannot mint more tokens. However, when tokens are burned by transferring or by exchanging back to Ethereum within a contract, the number becomes lower, and we can mint them again using the contract.
- Current Supply: The current supply shows the current amount of circulating tokens.
- Trade fees: No fees for a token purchase, 2% for converting back to Ethereum. Initial idea was to have no fees at all, however, people could avoid burning the token by converting it to Ethereum. This is an initiative to ensure that token will be used as intended, at least once.
- Everyone profits when Ethereum is taken away from the contract.
- Everyone profits when token is transferred from one account to another.
- Starting price: 1 Ethereum = 1 Hertz. From that point, Hertz price is always increasing.
- Minimum purchase: 0.000000000000000001
- Maximum purchase: Total Supply minus Current Supply



## Performance and expectations
 
- Burning function has been commented-out because it can be used to abuse the contract. For example, if person A and B invest, and then B decides to burn their tokens and A exchanges tokens back to Ethereum, we could have witnessed a possible money-laundering scheme. A 2% fee per transfer is good and slow enough to prevent this from happening.

- Initial (TODO: update with the $$ number) has been deposited in order to lower the price increase rate. For example if person A places $0.1 and then burn 2%, they would have increased the price for anyone else to purchase a token. For this reason, the price-safety deposit has been made right after the token launch.

- It is not possible to miss-out on this token’s increasing price since the price is always increasing. Furthermore, since everyone profits together from the burning, there is no ponzi-scheme.

- In the beginning, the price will oscillate around token’s contract price. This is why the name Hertz was chosen. However, as the token becomes spread across the accounts, this will become more predictive.

- It is my highest hope that bots will work together with the human traders and holders, and that everyone will profit. This is simply because bots can profit from arbitrage between the contract’s price and the exchanges. When this happens, we will have a constant and a straight line of an increasing price. This way, we will all profit from the bots as the bots will profit from the token and exchanges.
